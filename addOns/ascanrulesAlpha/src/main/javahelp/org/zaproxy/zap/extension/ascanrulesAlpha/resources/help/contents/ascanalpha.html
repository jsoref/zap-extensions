<H1>Active Scan Rules - alpha</H1>
The following alpha quality active scan rules are included in this add-on:

<H2>.htaccess Information Leak</H2>
Checks for web accessible .htaccess files which may leak sensitive information 
(such as usernames, error handling, redirects, directory listing settings, etc.).

<H2>An example active scan rule which loads data from a file</H2>
This implements an example active scan rule that loads strings from a file that the user can edit.<br>
For more details see:

<H2>Apache Range Header DoS (CVE-2011-3192)</H2>
Tests to see if the server is vulnerable to the Apache Range Header Denial of Service issue, by requesting eleven (11) 
different byte ranges. Eleven ranges is one more than is accepted by patched/fixed servers.

<H2>Cloud Metadata Attack</H2>
Attempts to abuse a misconfigured NGINX server in order to access the instance metadata maintained by cloud service providers such as AWS, GCP and Azure.<br>
All of these providers provide metadata via an internal unroutable IP address '169.254.169.254' - this can be exposed by incorrectly configured NGINX servers and accessed by using this IP address in the Host header field.

<H2>Cookie Slack Detector</H2>
Tests cookies to detect if some have no effect on response size when omitted, especially cookies containing the name "session" or "userid"

<H2>ELMAH Information Leak</H2>
Tests to see if the Error Logging Modules and Handlers (elmah.axd) HTTP Module is available. Although this module is handy for
developers and other stakeholders it can also leak a significant amount of information which a security analyst or malicious individual
may be interested in.<br><br>
The ELMAH scanner targets Microsoft based technologies: IIS, Windows, ASP, and MSSQL.

<H2>.env Information Leak</H2>
Checks for web accessible .env files which may leak sensitive information 
(such as usernames, passwords, API or APP keys, etc.).

<H2>Example Active Scanner: Denial of Service</H2>
This implements a very simple example active scan rule.<br>
For more details see: 
<a href="http://zaproxy.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/hacking-zap-4-active-scan-rules.html">Hacking ZAP Part 4: Active Scan Rules.</a>

<H2>GET for POST</H2>
This scanner takes <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> POST requests, changes the parameters from POST to GET and resubmits the request. 
If the GET response is the same as the original POST response then an alert is raised. While this does not necessarily
represent a security weakness unto itself it may indicate that other attacks or weaknesses can be expanded or simplified.
(Such as a POST based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack being changed to GET.)

<H2>Hidden File Finder</H2>
This scan rule checks for various web accessible files which may leak administrative, configuration, or credential information.
The built-in set of payloads are based on <a href="https://github.com/hannob/snallygaster">Snallygaster</a> by Hanno BÃ¶ck.
Such payloads are verified by checking response code, and content. If the response code is 200 (Ok) then additional content checks are performed to increase alert confidence.
If the response code is 401 (Unauthorized) or 403 (Forbidden) then an alert is raised with lower confidence.
<strong>Note:</strong> If the Custom Payloads addon is installed you can add your own hidden file paths (payloads) in the Custom Payloads options panel. 
For custom payloads only the response status code is checked. If there is a requirement to include a content check then it is also possible to add payloads to 
the <code>json/hidden_files.json</code> file in ZAP's user directory.
<p>
The following describes the fields of the JSON entries.
<pre><code>
{
  "path":"some/path/without/leading/slash.ext",
  "content":["content you want to find in responses"],
  "not_content":["content you do not want the response to have"],
  "binary":"\\x01\\x00",
  "links":["https://example.com/relevant/reference.html,"https://other.example.org/"],
  "type":"short_identifier",
  "source":"attribution_not_used_by_output_or_checks"
}
</code></pre>
<p>
Details worth noting:
<ul>
  <li>The only field that is required is path.</li>
  <li>The fields content, not_content, and links can have multiple quoted, comma separated values (arrays of strings).</li>
  <li>Checks of binary content are based on starting position 0 (ex: startsWith not contains).</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following is an example JSON entry:
<pre><code>
{
  "path":"CVS/root",
  "content":[":"],
  "not_content":["<"],
  "type":"cvs_dir",
  "source":"snallygaster"
}
</code></pre>

<H2>HTTP Only Site</H2>
This active scanner checks whether an HTTP site is served under HTTPS.

<H2>Httpoxy - Proxy Header Misuse</H2>
This active scanner checks whether a site is using the HTTP Proxy header specified in the request.<br>
It sets up an HTTP proxy which listens to all interfaces on a randomly assigned free port.
It then sends a series of requests to the target server with the HTTP Proxy header set to each of the available
IP addresses and the port that it is listening on.
If a request is received on the new port then the server is very likely to be vulnerable.<br>
<b>IMPORTANT</b> - the computer that ZAP is running on must accept incoming requests on arbitrary ports -
if a firewall prevents incoming connections then this rule will not work. 

<H2>HTTPS Content Available via HTTP</H2>
This active scanner attempts to access content that was originally accessed via HTTPS (SSL/TLS) via HTTP.

<H2>LDAP Injection</H2>
LDAP Injection may be possible. It may be possible for an attacker to bypass authentication controls, and to view and modify arbitrary data in the LDAP directory.

<H2>Proxy Disclosure</H2>
Attempts to detect and fingerprint proxy server(s). This information helps a potential attacker to determine:
<ul>
<li>A list of targets for an attack against the application.</li>
<li>Potential vulnerabilities on the proxy servers that service the application.</li>
<li>The presence or absence of any proxy-based components that might cause attacks against the application to be detected, prevented, or mitigated.</li>
</ul>

<H2>Relative Path Confusion</H2>
Tests if the web server is configured to serve responses to ambiguous URLs in a manner that is likely to lead to confusion about the correct "relative path" for the URL. 
If resources (CSS, images, etc.) are references in the response using relative, rather than absolute URLs. In an attack, if the web browser parses the "cross-content" response in a permissive manner, or can be tricked into 
permissively parsing the "cross-content" response, using techniques such as framing, then the web browser may be fooled into interpreting HTML as CSS (or other content types), leading to an XSS vulnerability.

<H2>Source Code Disclosure - File Inclusion</H2>
Uses local file inclusion techniques to scan for files containing source code on the web server.

<H2>Source Code Disclosure - Git</H2>
Uses Git source code repository metadata to scan for files containing source code on the web server.

<H2>SQL Injection - MsSQL</H2>
This active scanner attempts to inject MsSQL specific sleep commands into parameter values and analyzes the server's response time to see if the sleep is effectively executed on the server (indicating a successful SQL injection attack).

<H2>SQL Injection - SQLite</H2>
This active scanner attempts to inject SQLite specific commands into parameter values and analyzes the server's responses to see if the commands were effectively executed on the server (indicating a successful SQL injection attack).

<H2>Trace.axd Information Leak</H2>
Tests to see if Trace Viewer (trace.axd) is available. Although this component is convenient for developers and 
other stakeholders it can leak a significant amount of information which a security analyst or malicious individual
may be interested in.<br><br>
The trace.axd scanner targets Microsoft based technologies: IIS, Windows, ASP, and MSSQL.

<H2>User Agent Fuzzer</H2>
This active scanner checks for differences in response based on fuzzed User Agent (eg. mobile sites, access as a Search Engine Crawler). The scanner compares the response statuscode and the hashcode of the response body with the original response.<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> If the Custom Payloads addon is installed you can add your own User Agent strings (payloads) in the Custom Payloads options panel.

<H2>XSLT Injection Scanner</H2>
This active scanner checks for certain responses induced by injecting XSL transformations. <br/>
It attempts to obtain those responses with payloads which may induce: error responses, disclosure of library/framework vendor name, remote port scanning, or command execution.
